# React Blog App

In this project, I developed a BLOG application called `The Siren.`
This project taught me how to reuse components, retrieve data from parent to child components, and use props to pass data from one component to another.

And the following react concepts are covered on this site:

- `Functional Component` 
- `Props`
- `UseState Hook` 
- `Conditional rendering`
- `Context Api`
- `UseLocation`
- `React Router`



## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- `React`
- `Tailwind CSS`
